# Telecommunication-Customer-Churn-Analysis-EDA
This EDA project analyzes 7,000+ Telco records to uncover churn drivers. Using Python (Pandas/Seaborn), I visualized how contract types, tenure, and high charges impact retention. Key insight: long-term contracts significantly boost Customer Lifetime Value (CLV). Perfect for showcasing data-driven business strategy on GitHub.
